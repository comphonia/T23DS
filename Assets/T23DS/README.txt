Version: 0.1b(beta)

T23DS is currently in beta but out aim is to eventually provide a simple facial animation using unity blendshapes. Current Version only
says alphabets correctly, phonemes will be implemented soon to allow characters to speak words.

SETUP
- Add one of our characters to your scene
- Attach the "textTo3dSpeech" Script on it .... automatically adds an audiosource
- Drag the current speaker with the script component to the "Speaker" slot.
- Type in an alphabet
- Call the function "StartSpeaking();" using a button, a script or a trigger using the "t23DSTrigger" script
- Use the OnFinishedPlaying event to do something else after character has finished speaking
